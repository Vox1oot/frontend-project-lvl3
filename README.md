### SPA application for the aggregation of RSS feeds. The app receives a source as input, checks the source for updates every 5 seconds, and allows you to read each post as a short description, and a direct link to the specific post.

### Go to app -> [RSS-aggregator](https://morsa-frontend-project-lvl3.vercel.app/)

### Principle of operation:
The user enters the address of the source of interest into the aggregator. Then the aggregator itself checks the source for updates at 5-second intervals, and if they are available, adds the update to the list, and displays it on the screen. After that, the user has the opportunity to review the updates.
